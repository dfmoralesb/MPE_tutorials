Coalescent-based species tree inference with ASTRAL


ASTRAL is a java program for estimating a species tree given a set of unrooted gene trees. ASTRAL is statistically consistent under multi-species coalescent model (and thus is useful for handling ILS).


* To see the many options available in ATRAL you can type the following in the command line:

		java -jar astral.5.7.8.jar

The path where the *.jar file will depend of the local computer you are using. For example in my case is:

		java -jar ~/Apps/ASTRAL/Astral/astral.5.7.7.jar
